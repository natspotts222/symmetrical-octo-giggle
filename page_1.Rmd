# Rendering the site
1. Run `rmarkdown::render_site()` from the same directory as the `_site.yml` file.
2. View the output in the directory your YAML file specifies in `output_dir`. The template says: `output_dir: "docs"` so look in docs/.
3. Open the index.html file in your browser to view your handiwork.
